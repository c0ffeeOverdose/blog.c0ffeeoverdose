## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m just a regular computer science student.

Sometimes I feel like I *could* do something amazing… but most of the time I’m just too lazy to actually do it.

### ☕ Energy Drinks > Coffee

I’m more into energy drinks than coffee or tea.
Let’s be real — they’re tasty, sugar-free, affordable, and the caffeine hit isn’t overwhelming. What’s not to love?

### 🧠 Tech Stuff I’m Into

- **Main language:** Lua (don’t ask me why, it just happened)
- **Linux skills:** Mostly messing around with WSL2. I’ve spent time with Kali and Ubuntu — nothing too fancy, but I get by.
- **CyberSec & CTFs:** I like CTFs — my university sends me to compete sometimes. And occasionally I surprise myself like, “damn, maybe I *am* kinda good at this.”

### 🛠️ Not Quite There Yet

I *think* I’ve got a decent foundation.
But honestly? I don’t feel ready for the real-world job grind... yet. :(
